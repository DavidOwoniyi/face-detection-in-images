This is a simple program that detects faces in images.

It uses Python and OpenCV. 
OpenCV is a library that contains pretrained models that can be used for face detection.

The model used here is called: Haar cascade classifier for face detection.

The first step is to import the OpenCV library and load the face detection model.
We then specify the path of the image in which we want to detect faces.
We then use the model to detect faces in the image specified and then
draw rectangles on the faces.
We then show the image containing the detected faces using the matplotlib library.

The matplotlib library is a python library that is used for creating visualisations in python.
