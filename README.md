This simple program is designed for detecting faces in images using Machine Learning with Python, OpenCV, Matplotlib and Numpy.

### Features📍
* Face detection using pre-trained face detection model from OpenCV.
* Converts the input image to a format suitable for processing with OpenCV using the Numpy library.
* Draws bounding rectangles around detected faces and smiles.
* Displays the processed image with detected faces using the Matplotlib library.
* Efficient integration of Numpy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib libraries for image processing and visualization.

### Process Overview ♻️
* Use the Numpy library to convert the input image into a form suitable for OpenCV to work with.
* Import the OpenCV library and load the Haar cascade classifiers for face detection.
* Use the face detection model to detect faces in the specified image.
* Draw bounding circles around the detected faces.
* Display the image containing the detected faces using the Matplotlib library.
